This guide outlines the development life cycle for Paybill deployments, explaining its importance and how Paybill manages it efficiently.

A development life cycle (also known as the software development life cycle or SDLC) is a structured framework that ensures software is built, deployed, and maintained efficiently. It helps teams manage changes, collaborate effectively, and maintain stability in production environments. A well-defined development life cycle enhances software quality, improves efficiency, facilitates better collaboration between teams, reduces costs by catching issues early, and ensures long-term maintainability.

## Development Life Cycle in Paybill

Paybill enables teams to manage application changes and deployments effectively through its Environment and Version Management system. Key aspects of managing the development life cycle in Paybill include:

### Release Management

Using Paybill's release management, you can create multiple **[versions](/docs/development-lifecycle/release/version-control)** of your application and easily **[release](/docs/development-lifecycle/release/release-rollback)** the latest version with new features, fixes, and enhancements. Paybill also enables you to **[roll back](/docs/development-lifecycle/release/release-rollback.md)** to a previous stable version if needed.

### GitSync

  />

</div>

In Paybill, you can use **[GitSync](/docs/development-lifecycle/gitsync/overview)** to maintain a history and **[backup](/docs/development-lifecycle/backup/gitsync-backup)** of your application. By integrating with Git repositories, you can ensure that your application remains secure, organized, and easily manageable over time.
    
### Multi Environments
You can deploy multiple Paybill instances where each acts as a different environment. This setup isolates all resources as well as users across the instances. For more details, refer to the [Multi Environments](/docs/development-lifecycle/gitsync/multi-environment) Documentation.
